This is a personal website. Currently it only contains a web directory
of sites I find useful and/or interesting.

The page is implemented in Elm, because I like using Elm, and dislike
CSS & Javascript. Admittely Elm is overkill for a static page like
this...

## Compiling the Elm source


```
elm make --optimize --output=dist/js/main.js src/Main.elm
```
